// Problem 1

// Declare a JS object called carThree with
// A property called wheels with a number value

// A property called isBroken with a boolean value
// A property called color with a string value
// Use dot notation to add a new property called price with a number value
// Use bracket notation to add a new property called year with a number value
// Use dot notation to change the value of the isBroken property
// Use dot notation to read the value of owner
// Create a new variable (not part of the object) called clientIsInterested that has no value.
// Check if car color is blue. If true, set clientIsInterested to true, else false.
// Delete the owner property of carThree.

// Problem 4, 5

// Declare a JS object with 4 properties (4 keys and 4 values).
// Use dot notation to add a new property.
// Use bracket notation to add a new property.
// Use dot notation to change the value of one of the properties.
// Use dot notation to read the value of one of the properties.
